# Installation


The installation should be as easy as writing:

```shell
pip install shfl
```

Instead, if you want to install the package in editable mode, for developing purposes, you can link the package to the source code. 
From the main directory of the project, you can write: 

```shell
pip install -e .
```

The project documentation is mainly autogenerated from pydocs. If you want to generate the documentation, just go to the
documentation directory and execute:


```shell
python autogen.py
```

The documentation is created using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). If you want to see the web version of the 
documentation, you can serve after installing it within the documentation directory:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```
