# Model

The goal of the framework is to provide a set of common models that you might want to use. We don't want to restrict or 
prioritize the use of neural networks over other, more classical machine learning methods. We know that a lot of the machine 
learning-based services and products in the industry are built over conventional machine learning techniques. In any case, 
we are covering a huge range of models, including support for some popular deep learning frameworks. Of course, if you want 
to use your own model, the framework is easily extensible.

[TrainableModel](./#trainablemodel-class) is the abstract class that every model has to implement, in order to interact 
with all the pieces of the framework. [DeepLearningModel](./#deeplearningmodel-class) is a predefined model that takes 
a compiled keras or tensorflow model. If you want to define your own model, you just have to implement a class with methods 
defined by TrainableModel.
