    "# Differential privacy: basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a common situation in sociology where a researcher wants to develop a study about a certain property of a population. \n",
    "The point is that this property is very sensitive and must remain private because it could be embarrassing or illegal. \n",
    "However, the researcher can gain insight into the population, without compromising their privacy. \n",
    "There is a simple mechanism in which every person follows a randomization algorithm that provides \"plausible deniability\". \n",
    "Consider the following algorithm (see [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf), Section 2.3):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flip a coin;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If tails, then respond truthfully;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If heads, then flip a second coin and respond \"Yes\" if heads and \"No\" if tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the user answers \"Yes\", they could argue that this was due to the randomization algorithm and that it is not a true answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine that the researcher wants to use the previous algorithm to estimate the average number of people that have broken a particular law. \n",
    "The interesting point here is that they can obtain a very good approximation, while maintaining the privacy of every individual. \n",
    "Let's look at a specific example to get more familiar with the situation.\n",
