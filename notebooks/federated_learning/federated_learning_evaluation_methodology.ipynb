The problem with this methodology is that the local evaluation metrics are biased by the distribution of the test set data. That is, the performance of the local models is not properly represented when using a non-IID scenario (see notebook [Federated learning sampling methods](./federated_learning_sampling.ipynb)) because the distribution of training data for each client is different from that of the test data we use. For that reason, we propose the following evaluation methodology."

For example, the first client performed the worst in the global test, while it was the best in the local test. This indicates that the data distribution of this client is most likely very poor, compared to the global data distribution, for example, which consists of only two classes. This produces a really good local learning model in just one round of learning, being that it is a simpler problem, but with a very low global test performance.\n",
