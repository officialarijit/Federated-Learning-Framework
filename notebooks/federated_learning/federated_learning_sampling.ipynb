    "\n",
    "1. **Non-identical client distributions**: This is the case when data distributions from several clients do not follow the same probability distribution. The difference in probability distributions can be due to several factors:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1.1. *Feature distribution skew*: When data features of several clients follow different probability distributions. This case is typical for personal data, such as handwritten digits.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1.2. *Label distribution skew*: When label distribution varies across different clients. This kind of skew is typical for area-dependent data (species existing in a certain place).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1.3. *Concept shift*: When data features with the same label differ across different clients (same features, different label), i.e., due to cultural differences or when labels from data with the same features differ across different clients (same label, different features), i.e., due to personal preferences. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   1.4. *Unbalancedness*: It is common for the amount of data to vary significantly between clients.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Non-independent client distributions**: When the distribution of data from some clients somehow depends on the distribution of data from another. For example, cross-device FL experiments are performed at night, local time, which causes geographic bias in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-identical and non-independent distributions**: In real FL scenarios, data may be non-IID for several reasons simultaneously, due to the particular nature of the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have explained, the reasons why a dataset may be non-IID are manifold. At the moment, the framework implements *label distribution skew*. For each client, we randomly choose the number of labels it knows and which ones they are. We show the labels known by each client.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the options available are the same and have the same meaning as in the IID sampling. According to the *sampling* parameter, when *sampling = 'without_replacement'*, due to non-IID restrictions (clients with a reduced number of known labels), it is possible that some clients will receive less data than specified by the weights parameter, due to the lack of data from a certain label. This is also possible when *sampling = 'with_replacement'*, but is less likely, due to the fact that we can reuse data from some labels. It will only occur if the amount of data assigned to a client is greather than the total amount of data from the labels.\n",
