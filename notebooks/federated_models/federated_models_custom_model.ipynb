    "# Federated models: encapsulate a custom model in Sherpa.ai Federated Learning and Differential Privacy Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers the problem of encapsulating a custom machine learning model into the Sherpa.ai Federated Learning and Differential Privacy Framework for experimentation in the federated configuration.\n",
    "In this case, we will create a learning model from scratch and show how to make it interact with the Sherpa.ai Federated Learning and Differential Privacy Framework. \n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, a two-feature case of linear regression is considered, since an explicit formula for the minimization of the object function is available (see the [Introduction to statistical learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/), Section 3.1).\n",
    "For completeness, we assess the accuracy in a federated learning context, and we address the privacy level needed, in terms of sampling the sensitivity of our model for application of Differential Privacy. \n",
    "For a more extensive use of differential privacy with federated learning, see the notebooks on [Linear Regression](./federated_models_linear_regression.ipynb) and [K-means Clustering](./federated_models_clustering_k_means.ipynb).\n",
    "Also, see the notebook on [Regression using Keras](./federated_models_regression_deeplearning.ipynb), where a neural network model is used to perform regression. \n",

In the following, it is shown how to perform that by easy steps using Sherpa.ai framework. As shown below, by selecting a sensitivity we are ready to run the private federated experiment using the desired differential privacy mechanism.\n",

    "In the case of applying the Laplace privacy mechanism (see also: [Laplace Mechanism](../differential_privacy/differential_privacy_laplace.ipynb)), the noise added has to be of the same order as the sensitivity of the model's output (the values of the intercept and slope in our 2D linear regression). \n",
    "In the general case, the model's sensitivity might be difficult to compute analytically. \n",
    "An alternative approach is to attain random differential privacy through a sampling over the data (see [Rubinstein 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02562.pdf)). That is, instead of computing the global sensitivity $\\Delta f$ analytically, we compute an empirical estimation of it by sampling over the dataset.\n",
